 > * Images to get Alg ( ~ Hardcode, ~Universal~, Mostly Data Collection, Less Thinking )
 > * 2 Images to get the **Cube State** ***Scramble*** ( **Universal**, Image -> Matrix Mapping -> Scramble, Has more logical mapping Matrixes etc, More Thinking  )
 
<br>

###  How to

   1. Take
   2. Labelled images 3 sided Rubiks Cube image * 4 angles  ( Labelled  Alg number )

<br>

### 🌟 Getting the cube (OpenCV)

       1. [ ] Mark the cube

[Python OpenCV: Canny Edge Detection for Stickerless Rubik's Cube]( https://answers.opencv.org/question/230450/python-opencv-canny-edge-detection-for-stickerless-rubiks-cube/),
[OpenCV Canny](https://answers.opencv.org/question/25754/detect-and-analyze-a-rubik-cube/)

       1. [ ] Cutting the image to required form

       Output:
       >Image : *3 sided Rubiks Cube image*

<br>

### ⭐ AIM 1 (TensorFlow)

[Two sided PLL recogn](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2-Sided_PLL_Recognition)

- ### Find the PLL

       1. [ ] Map image to 21 Images of PLL (Using ML)
       2. [ ] Display the solution for the particular class  

       Output:
       >Alg : *Alg name and Alg (solution)*

<br>

### ⭐ AIM 2

- ### Converting it to cube in computer *py cube*

       1. [ ] Reading the images to get the colors 🌟
       2. [ ] Getting the scramble on the py cube 🌟🌟🌟 
       3. [ ] Finding a solution for it  <https://pypi.org/project/kociemba/>

       Output:
       >Alg : *Scramble (Cube State)*
