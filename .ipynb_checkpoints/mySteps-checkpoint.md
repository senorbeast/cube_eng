# Cube AI solver with **tensorflow** and **openCV**

<br>

 >### AIM 
 > * Images to get Alg ( ~ Hardcode, ~Universal~, Mostly Data Collection, Less Thinking )
 > * 2 Images to get the **Cube State** ***Scramble*** ( **Universal**, Image -> Matrix Mapping -> Scramble, Has more logical mapping Matrixes etc, More Thinking  )
 
<br>

  ###  How to 
   1. Take 
   2. Labelled images 3 sided Rubiks Cube image * 4 angles  ( Labelled  Alg number )

<br>

   - ###  🌟 Getting the cube (OpenCV)
       1. [ ] Mark the cube 
          * [Try this first](https://github.com/kkoomen/qbr)
          * [Python OpenCV: Canny Edge Detection for Stickerless Rubik's Cube]( https://answers.opencv.org/question/230450/python-opencv-canny-edge-detection-for-stickerless-rubiks-cube/)
          * [OpenCV Canny](https://answers.opencv.org/question/25754/detect-and-analyze-a-rubik-cube/)
           
       2. [ ] Cutting the image to required form
       
       Output:
       >Image : *3 sided Rubiks Cube image*

<br>

### ⭐ AIM 1 (TensorFlow)

[Two sided PLL recogn](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2-Sided_PLL_Recognition)

   - ### Find the PLL
       1. [ ] Map image to 21 Images of PLL (Using ML)
       2. [ ] Display the solution for the particular class  
       
       Output:
       >Alg : *Alg name and Alg (solution)*
       
<br>

### ⭐ AIM 2   
   - ### Converting it to cube in computer *py cube*
       1. [ ] Reading the images to get the colors 🌟
       2. [ ] Getting the scramble on the py cube 🌟🌟🌟 
       3. [ ] Finding a solution for it  https://pypi.org/project/kociemba/
    
       Output:
       >Alg : *Scramble (Cube State)*
